### Server & Desktop Apps

We have Worksuite Server and two Desktop Apps (for Windows/Mac/Linux):

- Worksuite¬Æ Worksuite‚Ñ¢ Server - includes Worksuite API, SQLite DB (or connects to external PostgreSQL) and serves Guazy frontend. It allows to quickly run Worksuite Server for multiple clients (browser based or Desktop based). It's recommended option if you want to setup Worksuite Worksuite Platform in the small to medium organizations.

- Worksuite¬Æ Worksuite‚Ñ¢ Desktop App - includes Worksuite frontend (UI), Worksuite API, SQLite DB, etc., all-in-one! It allows to quickly run the whole Worksuite solution locally, both UI and Timer (for time tracking, optionally of course). In addition, it allows to connect to the external database (e.g. PostgreSQL) or external API (if you have Worksuite Server with API / DB installed on different computer or if you want to connect to our live API). It's recommended option if you want to try Worksuite quickly / for personal use or if you want to connect to Worksuite Server in the "client-server" configuration (and use Desktop App instead of web browser).

- Worksuite¬Æ Worksuite‚Ñ¢ Desktop Timer App - allows to run Time & Activity Tracking for employees (agent) with screenshots and activity monitoring. Recommended to setup by organization employees as long as they are not interested in other Worksuite Platform features (e.g. accounting) and only need to track work time.

More information about our Server & Desktop Apps:

- Download for your OS from the official [Downloads](https://web.gauzy.co/downloads) page or see section "Download" above for other links to our releases pages.
- Setup Worksuite Server with default choices in Setup Wizard and run it.
- You can also setup Worksuite Desktop App (can run independently or connect to Worksuite Server) or Worksuite Desktop Timer App (should be connected to Worksuite Server)
- You can login with `admin@worksuite.co` and password `admin` to check Admin functionality if you installed Worksuite Server or Worksuite Desktop App. Note: such Admin user is not an employee, so you will not be able to track time.
- You can login with `employee@worksuite.co` and password `123456` to check Employee related functionality in Worksuite UI or to run Desktop Timer from "Employee" perspective (such user is an Employee and can track time).
- If you install Worksuite Server, it is possible to connect to it using browser (by default on <http://localhost:4200>) or using Worksuite Desktop Apps (make sure to configure Desktop apps to connect to Worksuite API on <http://127.0.0.1:3000/api> because it's where Worksuite Server API runs by default).
- You can read more information about our Desktop Apps in the [Desktop Apps Wiki Page](https://github.com/worksuiteio/worksuite/wiki/Worksuite-Desktop-Apps) and about our Server in the [Server Wiki Page](https://github.com/worksuiteio/worksuite/wiki/Worksuite-Server).

## üß± Technology Stack and Requirements

#### See also README.md and CREDITS.md files in relevant folders for lists of libraries and software included in the Platform, information about licenses and other details

## üìÑ Documentation

Please refer to our official [Platform Documentation](https://docs.gauzy.co) and to our [Wiki](https://github.com/worksuiteio/worksuite/wiki) (WIP).

## üöÄ Quick Start

### With Docker Compose

- Clone repo.
- Make sure you have Docker Compose [installed locally](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install).
- Copy `.env.compose` file into `.env` file in the root of mono-repo (file contains default env variables definitions). Important: file `.env.compose` is different to `.env.sample` in some settings, please make sure you use correct one!
- Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.demo.yml up`, if you want to run the platform using our prebuild Docker images. _(Note: it uses latest images pre-build automatically from head of `master` branch using Github CI/CD.)_
- Run `docker-compose up`, if you want to build everything (code and Docker images) locally. _(Note: this is extremely long process, option above is much faster.)_
- :coffee: time... It might take some time for our API to seed fake data in the DB during the first Docker Compose run, even if you used prebuild Docker images.
- Open <http://localhost:4200> in your browser.
- Login with email `admin@worksuite.co` and password: `admin` for Super Admin user.
- Login with email `employee@worksuite.co` and password: `123456` for Employee user.
- Enjoy!

Together with Worksuite, Docker Compose will run following:

- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) - Primary Database.
- [Pgweb](https://github.com/sosedoff/pgweb) - Cross-platform client for PostgreSQL DBs, available on <http://localhost:8081>.
- [Redis](https://github.com/redis/redis) - In-memory data store/caching.
- [ElasticSearch](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch) - Search Engine.
- [Dejavu](https://github.com/appbaseio/dejavu) - Web UI for ElasticSearch, available on <http://localhost:1358>.
- [MinIO](https://github.com/minio/minio) - Multi-Cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è Object Storage (AWS S3 compatible).
- [Cube](https://github.com/cube-js/cube) - "Semantic Layer" used for Reports, Dashboards, Analytics and other BI related features, with UI available on <http://localhost:4000>.

### Manually

#### Required

- Install [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/download) LTS version or later, e.g. 18.x.
- Install [Yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn) (if you don't have it) with `npm i -g yarn`.
- Install NPM packages and bootstrap solution using command `yarn bootstrap`.
- If you will need to make code changes (and push to Git repo), please run `yarn prepare:husky`.
- Adjust settings in the [`.env.local`](https://github.com/worksuiteio/worksuite/blob/develop/.env.local) which used in local runs.
- Alternatively, you can copy [`.env.sample`](https://github.com/worksuiteio/worksuite/blob/develop/.env.sample) to `.env` and change default settings there, e.g. database type, name, user, password, etc.
- Run both API and UI with single command: `yarn start`.
- Open Worksuite UI on <http://localhost:4200> in your browser (API runs on <http://localhost:3000/api>).
- Login with email `admin@worksuite.co` and password: `admin` for Super Admin user.
- Login with email `employee@worksuite.co` and password: `123456` for Employee user.
- Enjoy!

Notes:

- during the first API start, DB will be automatically seed with minimum set of initial data if no users found.
- you can run seed any moment manually (e.g. if you changed entities schemas) with `yarn seed` command to re-initialize DB (warning: unsafe for production!).
- it is possible to run generation of extremely large amount of fake data for demo purposes / testing with `yarn seed:all` (warning: takes ~10 min to complete)

#### Optional / Recommended for Production

- Optionally (recommended for production) install and run [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) version 14 or later. Note: other DB can be configured manually in TypeORM. The default DB is set to SQLite (recommended for testing/demo purposes only).
- Optionally (recommended for production) install and run [Redis](https://github.com/redis/redis). Note: the platform will work without Redis using in-memory caching strategy instead of distributed one (recommended for testing/demo purposes only).
- Optionally (recommended for production) install and run [ElasticSearch](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch). Note: the platform will work without ElasticSearch using DB build-in search capabilities (recommended for testing/demo purposes only).
- Optionally install and run [MinIO](https://github.com/minio/minio) or [LocalStack](https://github.com/localstack/localstack). Note: the platform will work without MinIO / LocalStack or other S3 compatible storage using local filesystem based storage (recommended for testing/demo purposes only). For production, we recommend to use Wasabi or AWS S3 storage.
- Optionally (recommended for production) install and run [Cube](https://github.com/cube-js/cube).

### Production

- See [Setup Worksuite for Client Server](https://github.com/worksuiteio/worksuite/wiki/Setup-Worksuite-for-Client-Server) for more information about production setup on your servers.
- For simple deployments scenarios (e.g. for yourself or your own small organization), check our [Kubernetes configurations](https://github.com/worksuiteio/worksuite/tree/develop/.deploy/k8s), which we are using to deploy Worksuite demo into [DigitalOcean k8s cluster](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes).
- In addition, check [Worksuite Pulumi](https://github.com/worksuiteio/worksuite-pulumi) project (WIP), it makes complex Clouds deployments possible with a single command (`pulumi up`). Note: it currently supports AWS EKS (Kubernetes) for development and production with Application Load Balancers and AWS RDS Serverless PostgreSQL DB deployments. We also implemented deployments to ECS EC2 and Fargate Clusters in the same Pulumi project.
